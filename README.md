# RSA Key Checker for CVE-2022-20866
A [vulnerability in the handling of RSA keys](https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-asaftd-rsa-key-leak-Ms7UEfZz) on devices running the Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance Software and Firepower Threat Defense Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to retrieve the RSA private key. This vulnerability is due to a logic error when the RSA key is stored in memory on a hardware platform that performs hardware based cryptography. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using a Lenstra side-channel attack against the targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to retrieve the RSA private key. 

The following conditions could be observed in a vulnerable device:

- The RSA key could be malformed and invalid. The malformed RSA key is not functional and a TLS client connection to a Cisco ASA or FTD device that uses the malformed RSA key will result in a TLS signature failure, which means a vulnerable software release created an invalid RSA signature that fails verification. If an attacker obtains the RSA private key, such key could be used to impersonate a Cisco ASA or FTD device.
- The RSA key could be valid but have specific characteristics that make it vulnerable to the potential leak of the RSA private key. If an attacker obtains the RSA private key, such key could be used to impersonate a Cisco ASA or FTD device. Please see the [security advisory Indicators of Compromise section](https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-asaftd-rsa-key-leak-Ms7UEfZz) for more information on the detection of this type of RSA key.

This tool allows you to check the private RSA key in the Cisco ASA or FTD devices.
