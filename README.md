# RSA Key Checker for CVE-2022-20866
A [vulnerability in the handling of RSA keys](https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-asaftd-rsa-key-leak-Ms7UEfZz) on devices running the Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance Software and Firepower Threat Defense Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to retrieve the RSA private key. This vulnerability is due to a logic error when the RSA key is stored in memory on a hardware platform that performs hardware based cryptography. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using a Lenstra side-channel attack against the targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to retrieve the RSA private key. 

This tool allows you to check the private RSA key in the Cisco ASA or FTD devices.
